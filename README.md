<h1>To-do List (Project Tutorial)</h1>

<h2>Things that I learned:</h2>

- Learned how to use useState and setting its' default in react
- Learned how to use event targeting to manipulate the data on the page and update the state
- Learned how to use the array method of .filter
- Learned a use case for the spread operator due to the tasks performing not as intended; on the creation of a new task, it would create a new to-do item and clump the previous items on the same line. Spread operator allowed each key value item pair to have be on their own respective element on the list as intended
- Learned how to use .map in order to render the useState variable contents to the page || also learned that .map does not affect the original array but just creates a copy of the original array with the affects you define
- Learned that adding the useState variable to the value of an input field that allows for the change of that input value and also the use of those inputs in your application
